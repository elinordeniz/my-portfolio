  "aboutText": "  I was born in 1998 in Istanbul, Turkey. I started at the university in 2016 in the Software Engineering department. After two years, I couldn't make it due to my health problems. Later I have gotten a bachelor's in Information Management Systems.\n\tI speak Turkish (native), English (advanced), Arabic (elementry), Dutch (elementry). Although I couldn't complete my software engineering bachelor's, I have always wanted to be a software developer. So I kept going little by little in time. Now I put all my effort into being a specialized full-stack developer. I think I am a good fit for this job. I am creative with a practical mind that allows me to approach problems from another perspective. One of my strengths is my competitive side which makes me more determined on a project I work on. The other is that when an error or a problem occurs on the project, I can be 100% concentrated on it until I have figured it out. I remember once I had tried to solve an issue in my code for a nonstop 16 hours.",
